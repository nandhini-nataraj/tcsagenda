							<p>  Hyderabad tour is incomplete without a visit to Charminar. An amazing blend of Indo-Islamic architecture, Charminar represents the glorious history of the city. Built in 1591 by Sultan Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah, Charminar is a square-shaped structure which is 56 meters high and 30 meters wide. Popularly known as ‘Arc de Triomphe of the East’, Charminar was constructed in the honour of Bhagmati, wife of Sultan Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah; immediately after he had shifted his capital to Hyderabad, which was earlier in Golconda. The name Charminar, which means “four (chaar)” “pillars (minars)” came from its structure which consists of four intricately carved pillars, one on each side.

							</p></br>

            <!-- <p>The inspiration of this design is said to have come from Shia "tazias" which have been built in the honour of son-in-law of Prophet Mohammad, Hussain. This square shaped architecture has towers in each of the four corners with all the sides of 20 metres in length. It has been built of granite and lime mortar. Each side opens into a plaza through giant arches, overlooking four major thoroughfares. Each arch has a width of 11 metres and height of 20 metres. The minarets cover a length of 48.7 metres from the ground to the apex. Each minaret of the building has four storeys. One can see the motif of Qutub Shahi buildings in the way each minaret has been constructed over base which looks like lotus leaf.

    	<p>  Golconda Fort Hyderabad is an outstanding example of brilliant engineering and magical architecture. Located at a distance of 11km from the city, it is the most famous of all Hyderabad sightseeing places. The name of the fort has been derived from the Telugu words "Golla" and "Konda" which together means 'Shepherd's Hill'. Founded in the approximately 12th Century by the Kakatiya Kings, this massive Golconda Fort with eight gates and 87 bastions was later built by Qutub Shahi Kings.
    	</p></br>
    	<p>One of the Hyderabad’s most popular and supreme monuments, Golconda Fort allures every visitor with its unparalleled beauty and grandeur. A Hyderabad Tour is incomplete without a visit to this fort.

    	However, do keep in mind the Golconda Fort timings and entry fee before planning a visit to this regal symbol of history. For instance, Golconda fort timings are from 9 am to 5.30 pm. After that, visitors are not allowed to enter the fort, unless they are going for the light and show in night. Hence, to explore the beauty of this place at leisure, plan you visit early in the day.</p>
